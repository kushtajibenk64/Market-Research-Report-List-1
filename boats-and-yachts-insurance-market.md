<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Boats and Yachts Insurance Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Actual Cash Value</li><li>Agreed Amount Value</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Boats and yachts insurance primarily encompasses two market types: Actual Cash Value (ACV) and Agreed Amount Value. ACV policies compensate the insured based on the current market value of the vessel, taking depreciation into account at the time of a claim. Conversely, Agreed Amount Value policies establish a predetermined value for the vessel at the policy's inception, ensuring that the owner receives that set amount in the event of a total loss, without depreciation considerations. This offers more financial security for boat owners.</p></p>
